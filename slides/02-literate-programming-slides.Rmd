# Motivating literate programming

## Issues

How to

* organize your work?
* make work more pleasant for yourself? (less tedium, less manual, less ...) 
* reduce friction for collaboration?
* reduce friction for communication?
* make your work navigable, interpretable, and repeatable by others?

A lot of this can be built into the normal coding and analysis process by using specific tools and habits.

## Getting the analysis right is only one link

Process, packaging, and presentation are often the weak links in the chain.

# Markdown

## What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a particular type of markup language. Markup languages are designed to produce documents from plain text.
    * You may be familiar with _LaTeX_, another (though less human friendly) text markup language.
* Tools render markdown to different formats (for example, HTML/pdf/Word). 
    * The main tool for rendering markdown is [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)).

## Why Markdown?

* Easy to learn and use. Focus on _content_, rather than _coding_ and debugging _errors_.
* Easy to edit yet very flexible. Can add HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* The rendering process is through tools and is thus an automatable and repeatable process.
* Lends itself well to version control, collaboration, sharing, and reuse.

## Markdown enables fast publishing to the web

**Markdown**: Easy to write and read in an editor

**HTML**: Easy to publish and read on the web

## Markdown versus HTML code {.code-columns}

## Medium header &lt;!-- header 2, actually --&gt;

It's easy to do *italics* or __make things bold__.

> All models are wrong, but some are useful. An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem. 

Code block below. Just affects formatting here.

```
x <- 3 * 4
```

I can haz equations. Inline equations, such as the average is computed as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$. Or display equations like this:

$$
\begin{equation*}
|x|= 
\begin{cases} x & \text{if $x\ge 0$,} \\\\
-x &\text{if $x\lt 0$.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

* `pandoc` is a swiss-army knife tool for conversion

# R Markdown

## R Markdown is rendered to Markdown {.code-columns}

```&#123;r&#125;

`knitr` offers a lot of control over representing different types of output. We can also have inline R expressions computed on the fly. The mean $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$ of the &#96;r length(x)&#96; random variates we generated is &#96;r round(mean(x), 3)&#96;. This figure is computed on-the-fly as well. No more copy-paste, including for figures:

```&#123;r&#125;
plot(density(x))
```
</pre>

## Can be rendered interactively in RStudio

<div style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;">
<img style="max-width: 96%;" src="media/knitrButton-screenshot.png"/>
</div>

## Rendering can be automated is thus repeatable

<div style="margin-top: 4em;"/>

From within R:
```r
rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd")
```

From the command line:
```bash
$ Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('filename.Rmd')"
```

## Summary

* R Markdown enables ideas and questions, the code that implements them, and the results generated by the implementation, to all stay together.

* R Markdown toolchain allows automated, repeatable rendering
    * for publishing to the web and viewing through a browser,
    * and (through LaTeX) to obtain a submittable manuscript (in PDF or Word).

* `knitr` is not limited to executing R code. See the book _Dynamic documents with R and knitr_ by Yihui Xie, part of the CRC Press / Chapman & Hall R Series (2013). ISBN: [9781482203530](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781482203530).
